    <h2>Origin and History of Mangoes</h2>
    <div class="origin-content">
      <p>
        Mangoes, known as the "king of fruits," have a rich history dating back over 4,000 years. They are believed to have originated in South Asia, particularly in India and Myanmar, where they were first cultivated. The mango tree (<em>Mangifera indica</em>) holds cultural and religious significance in many countries, especially in India, where it is considered a symbol of love and prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
        From South Asia, mangoes spread to other parts of the world through trade and exploration. By the 10th century, they had reached East Africa, and by the 16th century, Portuguese explorers introduced them to Brazil and the Caribbean. Today, mangoes are grown in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including the Philippines, Mexico, and Thailand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mangoes are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. They are rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants, making them a healthy and refreshing treat. At MangoHouse, we take pride in offering you the finest mangoes, sourced from the best orchards to ensure quality and taste.
